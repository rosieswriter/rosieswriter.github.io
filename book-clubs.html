<p>If your book club or reading group is reading <em>Helen In Love</em> and you’re in the area, I’d be delighted to talk to your group. Email me and we can schedule a time for me to attend your event. I also make book club visits via Skype if you’re not in the Boston area. The novel is an American Library Association Book Club Pick.</p>
